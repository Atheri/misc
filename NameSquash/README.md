NameSquasher

Takes two strings and combines them together in a specific way. Given two
strings a, b and string's indexes i, j then combine the strings like (python)
    a[:i+1] + b[j:]

Prints all variations of this combination 
0 <= i < len(a)
0 <= j < len(b) 

Just wanted a quick list, my girlfriend and I were talking about if combining
our names would result in anything you could actually name someone.
